            <p>
              Unstoppable and constant apprentice. Since I was in school, I have
              loved to spend a lot of time navigating the Internet looking for
              new things to know and learn. At the beginning of 2022, I started
              to get interested in Web Development and all kind of stuff
              Software Engineering-related like programming and testing. I
              finished a FullStack JavaScript Bootcamp given by Digital House,
              which allowed me to have a better understanding of the development
              world. Nowadays, I'm focused on continue learning web development,
              and I want to get some experience building personal projects and
              getting a job as a junior in any company. I'm highly motivated to
              learn and work.

                  LeanTech launched a program called Junior Developers Bootcamp
                  (JDB). This was a program sponsored by Advent International
                  whose purpose was to train junior developers for 4 months to
                  incorporate them into their different projects. As a junior
                  trainee, my main tasks were:
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Attend daily English classes given by a professional English
                    teacher
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Participate in live frontend and backend classes (Angular
                    and .NET)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Submit daily and biweekly individual and group tasks and
                    projects
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Dedicate at least 4 hours a day to the study of the
                    different topics that we were taught (JavaScript,
                    TypeScript, C#, Angular, .Net, DataBases, Data Structures)
                  </li>
                </ul>

                  I was in charge of giving technical support for all kinds of
                  customers with any doubt or problem with their services:
                  Internet, t.v, and phone. I learned to use Zendesk and some
                  other complex applications for providing this support.
