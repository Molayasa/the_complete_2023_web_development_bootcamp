  <p>
    Unstoppable and constant apprentice. Since I was in school, I have loved to
    spend a lot of time navigating the Internet looking for new things to know and
    learn. At the beginning of 2022, I started to get interested in Web
    Development and all kind of stuff Software Engineering-related like
    programming and testing. I finished a FullStack JavaScript Bootcamp given by
    Digital House, which allowed me to have a better understanding of the
    development world. Nowadays, I'm focused on continue learning web development,
    and I want to get some experience building personal projects and getting a job
    as a junior in any company. I'm highly motivated to learn and work.
